Pixel Art Maker!

This is a simple JavaScript program that allows you to pick a grid size, and then any colour you wish from an RBG pallet. 

Simply click the square you want to fill out and you're done!

If you make a mistake, don't worry, click on the same square again and it will be erased.


Happy pixel art making!
